# CodespaceTest
Testing codespace for programming on chromebooks, I was able to install p5.js in codespaces and show some basic demonstration code for students.
This will allow us to begin implementing github classroom, students won't really need to install the p5.js extension because I'll be pushing code to them, but I'll still demonstrate this process so that students know how it's done.
